            <p>HE WAS A YOUNG MAN JUST BEGINNING TO BUILD HIMSELF. AFTER FINISHING 10TH GRADE, HE FOUND A PASSION FOR THE GYM, SHAPING HIS BODY WITH THE SAME DISCIPLINE HE APPLIED TO EVERYTHING ELSE.</p>

            <p>HE GREW UP IN HIS MAMAGHAR IN ITAHARI, SURROUNDED BY COUSINS WHO WERE MORE LIKE HIS SIBLINGS. HE WAS THE GLUE THAT HELD THEM TOGETHER.</p>
